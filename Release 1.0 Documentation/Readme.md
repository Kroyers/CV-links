# Hellish Happenings at the Night
## Preface
This is a game created by the authors Fahimeh Fereydounian, JÃ¡n Jeremy Tugsbayar, Mara Pack, Niklas Rheinberg and Nikolaos Kotarelas for the course Game Development lab at RWTH Aachen in winter semester 2023/2024.

## Known bugs
1) Batteries do not shine in the MacOs build version, but do in the Windows version. 
2) Clicking settings sometimes bugs the game. 
3) Enemy gets stuck behind a corner caused by a opened door.
4) Opening notes doesn't work on first try.
5) Weird lag spikes/frame drops sometimes.

## What more could be done
1) Add player model and animations (especially hands).
2) Custom enemy model and animation.
3) More variety of objectives
4) Improved enemy AI.
5) Custom keybindings.
6) Save game function.
7) Higher quality and more appropiate voice lines.
8) Better surround sound design.

All of the above are "game functionalities". Once these would be impleneted, the "content" of game could be expanded to have different levels with more variety, different story and setting. 

## Lessons learnt
1) Unity sucks for more complicated games.
2) Just being a regular "gamer" doesn't imply you can design a good game. But being a good game critiquer or a programmer is helpful, as it gives deeper insight into game design.
3) Making a game is both easier and harder than expected.
